The underlying data (https://api.geonet.org.nz/) is in the public domain, and used according to the data policy outlined at http://www.geonet.org.nz/policy.\n\nThe app (optionally) uses relative location metrics (e.g. \"quake 53km away\"). The API is only monitoring New Zealand quakes, but since it can be used without a device location in New Zealand I'm offering it as a global skill. Try setting your address to city=Wellington and postcode=6011. If you need a street address, add '59 Clyde Street'",
